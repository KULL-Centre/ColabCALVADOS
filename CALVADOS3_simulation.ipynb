Detailed instructions can be found in Cell 2.\n","\n","(Optional) Coarse-grained trajectories are converted to all-atom trajectories using cg2all [5].\n","\n","Small angle X-ray scattering curves are calculated using polynomial expansions of protein structures and interactions Pepsi-SAXS [6].\n","\n","Bayesian/Maximum Entropy Reweighting is performed using the BME Python library [7,8].\n","\n","Usage\n","MD simulations run on GPU. To enable GPU select Runtime from the menu, then Change runtime type and select GPU.\n","\n","Note: Cells for preliminary operations should be executed one by one to prevent crashes. This notebook uses condacolab, whose installation will cause a kernel restart. Because of this, a crash will happen during preliminary operations if you execute all cells at once.\n","\n","### References\n","\n","If you use this notebook, you may consider citing the following papers:\n","\n","1.
